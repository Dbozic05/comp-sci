Following on from my investgation, it is clear from the results of my questionnare that my artefact will need to track sleeping conditions using the thermometer to measure the temperature of the room and the light sensor to measure the light level iin the room. I will use a cheap and easy device like a micro:bit to carry out this task. I will gather this data, validate them and store them in using python modules like matplotlib. Then using this information we could predict future decisions with relation to the light level and temperature data. I will then create a computer model based on the dataset with answering a few "what if " type questions which I will make up to meet the requirements of the brief. This will meet the brief as it asks to link it to wellbeing and sleep is a factor of wellbeing on daily basis of our lives.
