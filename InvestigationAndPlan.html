<h1><center>Investigation & Plan</center></h1>
<p>Here I will talk about my Investigation and Planning</p>
  My thoughts are: 

     1.Monitoring sleep activity 

     2.Monitoring physical activity like steps 

     3.Monitoring Stress levels 


   In the end, I ended up with monitoring sleep activity as I find it most ideal to do.  I chose this as this suited me better, it ticks all the boxes for the basic and the advanced tasks of the brief of the project.  There are similar products like:  



  The Oura Ring 

  The Oura Ring is a smart device like a smart ring used to track physical like steps and sleep activity. The company was founded in 2013. It is an expensive device to buy, so I will make a cheaper device. The Oura ring device shines light beams through your skin and uses sensors to measure your respiratory rate, heart rate, HRV, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. It has a subscription based fee, around $5.99 per month. I will make a similar device but for sleep and without a subscription fee. The Oura ring is to be worn on the index finger and it uses 3D accelerometer.  


  I plan to track temperature and light using the sensor involved. Either using OLED to tell the user that e.g that the temperature is too high or the lights are too bright in the room or then maybe a servo for that if the room is too warm, the servo could open a window. Most doctors recommend keeping the temperature around between 15.6 degrees Celsius to 20 degrees Celsius for the most ideal sleep with reference from 
   <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep#:~:text=The%20best%20room%20temperature%20for,for%20the%20most%20comfortable%20sleep.">Sleep Foundation</a> Another source saying that to keep your room temperature to around 15 to 19 degrees Celsius from <a href=" https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-the-ideal-sleeping-temperature-for-my-bedroom"</a>. And if we average that up between these 2 it is around 15.3 degrees Celsius to 19.5 degrees Celsius for optimal sleeping conditions as it should be "cool, dark and quiet".
